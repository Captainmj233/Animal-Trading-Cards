    <p>Elephants are majestic, intelligent mammals known for their large size, distinctive trunk, and impressive tusks.
         They are highly social animals, living in tight-knit family groups led by a matriarch. 
         With their keen intelligence and remarkable memory, elephants display complex behaviors, including communication through a variety of vocalizations,
          body language, and even through seismic vibrations sensed through their feet.</p>
